\subsection{Abstract (200 words)}\label{abstract-200-words}}

Distinguishing between genetic, environmental, and
genotype-by-environment effects is central to understanding geographic
variation in phenotypic clines. Two of the best-documented phenotypic
clines are Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule, which predict larger body
sizes and shortened extremities in colder climates, respectively.
Although numerous studies have found inter- and intraspecific evidence
for both ecogeographic patterns, we still have little understanding
about whether these patterns are driven by genetics, environment, or
both. Here, we measure the genetic and environmental contributions of
Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule across introduced populations of house
mice (\emph{Mus musculus domesticus}). We find a genetic basis for
Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule in house mice, as mice from colder
climates are larger with shorter tails than mice from tropical
environments. We found very little plasticity associated with body size,
suggesting that Bergmann's rule has been shaped by strong directional
selection in house mice. Extremities show considerable plasticity in
response to cold, as both tails and ears grow shorter in cold
environments. The plastic responses of house mouse extremities mirror
general evolutionary patterns of shorter extremities in colder
environments, demonstrating an example of adaptive phenotypic
plasticity. Together, our study suggests that adaptive plasticity
underlying Allen's rule, in combination with strong selection for
Bergmann's rule, likely facilitated the rapid expansion of house mice
into new environments across the Americas.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Clines in phentoypes have historically been attributed to natural
selection and reflect adaptation to local environments (Huxley 1939;
Endler 1977). Two of the most well described phenotypic clines are
Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule. Allen's rule predicts shorter
extremities in colder climates compared to warmer regions, producing
latitudinal clines in extremity length (Allen 1877). Bergmann's rule
predicts larger body sizes in colder climates compared to warmer
habitats, generating latitudinal clines in body size (Bergmann 1847).
Shortened extremities and larger body sizes minimize heat loss by
reducing surface area to volume ratios and are viewed as
thermoregulatory adaptations (Mayr 1956). Numerous studies have
documented Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule within and across species of
birds (Johnston and Selander 1964; James 1970; Laiolo and Rolando 2001;
Romano et al. 2020) and mammals (Brown and Lee 1969; Griffing 1974;
Yom-Tov and Nix 1986; Fooden and Albrecht 1999), including humans (Ruff
1994, 2002; Foster and Collard 2013; Betti et al. 2015). Moreover,
various meta-analyses have supported (Ashton et al. 2000; Ashton 2002;
Freckleton et al. 2003; Meiri and Dayan 2003; Blackburn and Hawkins
2004; Millien2006; Olson2009; Symonds and Tattersall 2010; Nudds and
Oswald 2007) or refuted (McNab 1971; Geist 1987; Gohli and Voje 2016;
Riemer et al. 2018) an evolutionary basis to these phenotypic clines.
The contradicting results found across the literature are unsurprising
given the variation within and among datasets, such as choice of
taxonomic groups, environmental variables, and inconsitencies in
morphological measurements. To date, we still have very little
understanding of the mechanisms underlying Allen's rule and Bergmann's
rule.

Missing from many of these discussions are careful analyses determining
which traits are genetically encoded, environmentally influenced, or
both. Most traits associated with Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule are
quantitative, meaning they are polygenic and environmentally determined
(Falconer and Mackay 1996; Lynch et al. 1998). Disentangling genetics
from environmental effects in natural populations is difficult when
solely using phenotypic data collected from wild-caught specimens.
Patterns consistent with Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule may exist
underneath environmental effects and possible genotype-by-environment
interactions (Conover and Schultz 1995; Alho et al. 2011). Phenotypic
plasticity may also generate clinal patterns, giving a false indication
for adaptive clines (James 1983). In fact, many temporal patterns of
Bergmann's rule are driven by the environment and not genetic adaptation
in birds (Teplitsky et al. 2008; Husby et al. 2011) and mammals (Ozgul
et al. 2009, 2010). Furthermore, we have little understanding how
populations conforming to these ecogeographic rules vary in the degree
and direction of plasticity they exhibit in response to environmental
stimuli. Variation in plasticity and gentoype-by-environment
interactions may faciliate adaptation and divergence in polygenic traits
(Via and Lande 1985; Gillespie and Turelli 1989; Gomulkiewicz and
Kirkpatrick 1992; West-Eberhard 2003). However, controlling for
environmental effects and measuring the contributions of phenotypic
plasticity is difficult, as transplant experiments and common garden
experiments are infeasible for many taxa. These limitations have impeded
our ability to make substantial progress on understanding the
evolutionary and ecological mechanisms underlying Bergmann's rule and
Allen's rule.

House mice (\emph{Mus musculus domesticus}) are a tractable system to
dissentangle the genetic and environmental contributions underlying
complex traits. House mice have recently expanded their range from
Western Europe to the Americas, where they can be found from the tip of
South America up to Alaska. Across this broad latitudinal range, house
mice are exposed to various environmental gradients, from cold,
temperate environments to warm, tropical and arid environments
(Phifer-Rixey and Nachman 2015). Despite house mice residing in these
novel environments for only \textasciitilde{}500 generations
(Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018), there is evidence for clinal adaptation
across populations. Specifically, mice in eastern North America follow
Bergmann's rule (Lynch 1992), with larger mice in more northern
populations compared to their southern conspecifics. These body size
differences persist in a commmon environment and over many generations,
indicating a genetic basis for Bergmann's rule in house mice (Lynch
1992; Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018). Experimental evolution studies of house
mice conducted in the laboratory recapitulate these clinal patterns, in
which mice bred at lower temperatures become larger and undergo genetic
divergence in body size (Barnett and Dickson 1984). Furthermore, earlier
work revealed an environmental influence on tail length when exposed to
cold temperatures. Specficially, house mice reared in a cold environment
grew significantly shorter tails than mice reared at warm temperatures,
consistent with Allen's rule (Sumner 1909, 1915; Barnett 1965). However,
these earlier studies either only investigated a single population of
wild house mice or used traditional laboratory strains of mice, making
it difficult to place the results in an explicit evolutionary framework.
We still have little understanding of the phenotpic variation of house
mice across their entire latitudinal distribution, and the subsequent
contributions of genetics and the environment on these complex traits.

Here, we use a combination of approaches to tease apart genetics from
plasticity in Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule in American house mice.
First, we determined if house mice conform to both Bergmann's rule and
Allen's rule across their entire introduced range by analyzing
phenotypic data from wild-caught individuals across North and South
America. Second, because it is difficult to dissentangle genetics from
plasticity using wild phenotypic data, we collected temperate and
tropical populations of house mice from the ends of their latitudinal
distribution, brought them back to the lab, and established wild-derived
colonies. We analyzed phenotypic differences between populations and
across generations in a common environment to identify a genetic basis
for Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule. Third, to measure the influence of
environment on body size and extremity length, we performed a second
common garden experiment by rearing both populations of house mice in a
cold environment and measured the effects on body size and extremity
length. Measuring developmental plasticity within and between
populations allows us to assess the influence of temperature on complex
traits and the evolutionary mechanisms underlying these clinal patterns.
Specifically, we show that unlike body size, extremity length is highly
plastic, and this plastic response goes in the same direction as the
evolved response, highlighting an example of adaptive phentoypic
plasticity.

To determine if house mice conform to Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule,
we tested for associations between body mass, tail length, ear length,
and latitude in wild house mice collected across North and South
America. We dowloaded specimen data of all house mouse records from
VertNet (Constable et al. 2010) on October 13, 2020, using the search
query: \emph{vntype}:specimen, \emph{genus}:Mus. We obtained 62,139
museum records and retained records that included \emph{Mus musculus}
specimens collected in North or South America (excluding islands). We
further excluded individuals listed as pregnant, juvenile, subadult, or
immature, and kept those identified as adult, mature, or with no age
class noted. We also manually coded females and males as `adult' if they
fulfilled any of the following criteria: females - presence of placental
scars, parous, or lactating; males - presence of seminal vesicles,
testes descended (TD), or testes scrotal (TS). Tail lengths shorter than
20mm and longer than 120mm (\emph{n} = 8), and ear lengths greater than
30mm (\emph{n} = 1) were considered extreme outliers (greater than 3.5
standard deviations from the mean) and were removed from downstream
analyses, as these likely represent juveniles or measuring erros. Sample
information for the final VertNet dataset (n = 3,018) is provided in
Data S1.

For the first common garden experiment, we collected live animals from
two locations that represent the ends of the latitudinal transect:
Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (MAN) and Saratoga Springs, New York, USA
(SAR). Details of this common garden experiment are specified in
(Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018; Suzuki et al. 2020). Briefly, live mice from
both Brazil and New York were brought back to the lab at the University
of California, Berkeley. Within each population, unrelated pairs of
wild-caught mice were mated to produce first generation (N1) lab-reared
mice, and these inbred lines have subsequently been maintained through
sib-sib matings each generation for over 10 generations. Wild-caught
mice and their descendants were housed in a standard laboratory
environment at 21\textsuperscript{o}C with a 12-hr dark and 12-hr light
cycle. Commerical rodent chow was provided ad libitium. Standard museum
measurements were taken for all wild-caught, N1, and N2 mice from each
population (see Data S3). Tail lengths less than 50mm (\emph{n} = 2) and
ear lengths less than 8mm (\emph{n} = 1) were considered outliers
(greater than three standard deviations away from the mean) and were
removed from downstream analyses.

For the second common garden experiment, we used two wild-derived inbred
lines each from Brazil (MANA, MANB) and New York (SARA, SARB). Each line
was over 10 generations of inbreeding. Equal numbers of males and
females were produced for each within-line comparison (n = 656; see Data
S4). Full sibs were born at room temperature (21\textsuperscript{o}C)
and singly-housed at weaning (\textasciitilde{}21 days old). After a
brief acclimation period, we randomaly assigned 3.5-week-old mice into
sized matched groups based on sex-specific body mass, and housed at
either 5\textsuperscript{o}C or remained at 21\textsuperscript{o}C for
the duration of the experiment (\textasciitilde{}50 days total). We
measured initial body weights and tail lengths and recorded subsequent
weekly body mass and tail lengths once a week for each mouse. At the end
of the experiment, we sacrificed mice at 75 ± 3 days of age, and
recorded final body masses and tail lengths, in addition to standard
museum measurements. Two final ear lengths were not included in analyses
due to ear damage. We deposited skulls and skeletons of all mice in the
Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley. All
experimental procedures were in accordance with the UC Berkeley
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP-2017-08-10248).

All data analyses and visualizations were completed in R (v. 4.0.3).
Within R, we used the tidyverse (v. 1.3.0)(Wickham et al. 2019),
performance (v. 0.7.1)(Lüdecke et al. 2021), cowplot (v. 1.1.1), here
(v. 1.0.1), and rmarkdown (v. 2.7)(Allaire et al. 2021) packages, along
with R base library. Tail length residuals and ear length residuals were
calculated by regressing absolute length from body mass. Residuals
calculated from body mass consistently performed better (i.e., lower
Akaike's information criterion (AIC) values) across all datasets than
residuals calculated from body length. We controlled for the effect of
body size on extremity length when testing for Allen's rule by including
body mass as an additional predictor in all statistical models
(Freckleton 2002).

We tested for clinal patterns of body mass and extremity length across
latitude in wild-caught house mice using Spearman correlations. For
common garden experiment one, we fitted a linear model using lm\{stats\}
to predict body mass, tail length, and ear length with sex, population,
and generation (formula: (trait) \textasciitilde{} Body Mass + Sex *
Population * Environment). The significance of interactions were tested
were evaluated using summary\{base\} and analysis of variance (ANOVA)
based on type III (partial) sums of squares, implemented in the CAR
library (v. 3.0.10)(Fox and Weisberg 2019). For common garden experiment
two, we fitted a linear mixed model (estimated using restricted maximum
likelihood) using lmer\{lme4\} (v. 1.1.26)(Bates et al. 2015) to predict
body mass, tail length, and ear length with sex, population and
environment (formula: (trait) \textasciitilde{} Body Mass + Sex *
Population * Environment). The model included line as a random effect
(formula: \textasciitilde{}1 \textbar{} Line). Results were evaluated
using summary\{lmerTest\} (v. 3.1.3)(Kuznetsova et al. 2017) and
Anova\{car\}. We peformed \emph{post hoc} comparisons on significant
two-way interactions using Tukey's HSD tests or Mann-Whitney \emph{U}
tests. The code to perform analyses for this study are available as a
git-based version control repository on GitHub
(\url{https://github.com/malballinger/Ballinger_allenbergmann_XXXX_2021}).
The analysis can be reproduced using a GNU Make-based workflow with
built-in bash tools (v. 3.2.57(1)-release) and R (v. 4.0.3).

We assessed the relationship between tail length, ear length, body mass,
and latitude in mice collected across North and South America to
determine if populations of house mice conform to Allen's rule and
Bergmann's rule. Using a large dataset downloaded from VertNet (n =
3,018, Data S1), we find weak evidence for Bergmann's rule, as body mass
showed a non-significant, positive correlation with latitude across both
males and females (Figure 1A). In contrast, we found stronger evidence
for Allen's rule in American house mice, with tail length (Figure 1C)
and ear length (Figure 1E) showing a significant, negative correlation
with latitude. These patterns of extremeity length largely hold true
across both sexes (Figure 1C, 1E).

Lack of significant evidence for Bergmann's rule in wild house mice is
likely due to the influence of uncontrolled factors (e.g., age, diet,
health), environmental effects, or phenotypic plasticity. Although we
minimized the inclusion of records of non-adult specimens by removing
pregnant females, juveniles, and subadults, we still see large variation
across all three traits, likely due to various factors that were not
recorded. To reduce this variation, we filtered the VertNet dataset to
only include adult males (Figure 1B, 1D, 1F; n = 445). We see strong
evidence for both Bergmann's rule (Figure 1B) and Allen's rule (Figure
1D, 1F) across adult, male American house mice, highlighting how
variation and noise encompassed in collated museum metadata makes
inferring broad ecogeographic patterns difficult.

Phenotypic clines observed across wild house mouse populations could
represent genetic differences, phenotypic plasticity, or both. To
dissentagnle genetics from plasticity, we collected live mice from the
ends of the latitudinal transect (Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil and Saratoga
Springs, New York, USA) and brought them into a common laboratory
environment. Population-specific differences in body mass in wild-caught
mice (N0) persisted across the first two generations of
laboratory-reared mice (N1 and N2; Figure 2A). Specifically, mice from
New York are larger than mice from Brazil (Kruskal--Wallis,
\emph{F}\(_{1,439}\)=282.54, \emph{P}\textless{}0.001) (Figure 2A;
Figure S1), and these differences persisted across generations
(Mann-Whitney \emph{U}, P \textless{} 0.001). Sex-specific differences
in body mass were also seen across generations, with males larger than
females (Kruskal--Wallis, \emph{F}\(_{1,439}\)=50.79,
\emph{P}\textless{}0.001) (Figure 2A; Figure S1), and the direction and
magnitude of sexual dimorphism was the same among New York and Brazil
house mice. The maintance of body mass differences in a common
environment and across generations suggests a strong genetic basis in
house mice.

Extremity length (i.e.~tail length and ear length) showed considerable
variation across wild-caught mice (N0) and laboratory-reared mice (N1
and N2; Figure 2B-C). Despite this variation, Brazil mice have longer
tails than New York mice (ANCOVA, \emph{F}\(_{1,419}\)=42.12,
\emph{P}\textless{}0.001) (Figure 2B; Figure S1), and these differences
have persisted across generations in a common environment (Tukey's HSD,
P \textless{} 0.001), suggesting a genetic basis for tail length in
house mice. Ear length showed the most variation, with no strong trends
between populations (Figure 2C; Figure S1). Variation in extremity
length could be due to multiple investigators measuring tail length and
ear length across generations, or it could reflect plasticity in
extremity length. For example, although tail length decreases slightly
across generations (Figure 2B), it is difficult to discern if this is
due to phenotypic plasticity or noise being captured in the metadata.
Regardless, extremity length shows greater variation than body mass,
even when measured in a common garden experiment.

The results presented above identified phenotypic divergence in body
mass and tail length in house mice, with New York mice having shorter
tails and larger body sizes than mice from Brazil, consistent with
Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule, respectively. To determine the
influence of phenotypic plasticity on Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule,
we performed a second common garden experiment by rearing
laboratory-born mice from both populations in a cold environment. We
used temperature as the environmental variable as environmental
temperature is highly correlated with latitude (Millien et al. 2006) and
phenotypic variation in wild house mice across North and South America
is explained most by temperature-related variables (Suzuki et al. 2020).
Evolved differences in body mass were evident at weaning (Figure 3),
with New York mice larger than Brazil mice. These body mass differences
persisted across development and sex and were not influenced by
temperature (Figure 3). At the end of the experiment, body size
differences recapitulated patterns seen across generations, with New
York mice larger than Brazil mice (\(\chi^2\)=4,
\emph{P}\textless{}0.05) and males larger than females
(\(\chi^2\)=42.15, \emph{P}\textless{}0.001 (Figure 5, Figure S2). The
lack of plasticity in body mass is not a result of differences in fat
accumulation, as body mass index (BMI) does not differ between
populations (\(\chi^2\)=0.50, \emph{P}\textgreater{}0.05) or
environments (\(\chi^2\)=1.28, \emph{P}\textgreater{}0.05) (Figure S3;
Figure S4). This suggests that phenotypic plasticity plays a modest role
in body size evolution of house mice.

In contrast to body mass, tail length is greatly influenced by
developmental temperature, with the first few weeks post-weaning having
the greatest influence on absolute tail length (Figure 4). Specifically,
mice reared in a cold enviornment grew shorter tails than mice reared in
a warm environment (ANCOVA, \(\chi^2\)=86.05, \emph{P}\textless{}0.001;
Tukey's HSD, \emph{P}\textless{}0.01) (Figure 6A). Despite developmental
temperature playing a signficant role in tail length, evolved
differences in tail length were evident at the end of the experiment,
with Brazil mice growing longer tails than New York mice (ANCOVA,
\(\chi^2\)=11.71, \emph{P}\textless{}0.001) (Figure 6A; Figure S2).
Thus, tail length exhibits both evolved divergence and phenotypic
plasticity. Similarly, cold-reared mice grew shorter ears than
warm-reared mice (ANCOVA, \(\chi^2\)=57.66, P\textless{}0.001) (Figure
6B; Figure S2), with no population-specific differences. These
temperature-growth reponses of the extremeites are not a simple
consequence of body size modification, as body mass does not differ
between treatments (Figure 5). Overall, unlike body size, extremity
length showed significant plasticity in response to temperature, with
mice growing shorter extremities in a cold environment, consistent with
patterns of Allen's rule.

Differences between warm- and cold-reared mice revealed a strong plastic
response to temperature in extremity length. Because plasticity is
considered adaptive when a phenotype is altered in the same direction as
natural selection (Ghalambor et al. 2007), we next asked whether
phenotypic plasticity of Brazil mice goes in the same or opposite
direction as the evolved response of New York mice. For tail length, the
plastic response in Brazil house mice recapitulates the evolved tail
length of New York mice (Figure 6A), highlighting an example of adaptive
phenotypic plasticity. Interestingly, the plastic response of New York
tail length is attenuated in comparison to Brazil's (Figure 6A),
suggesting that New York house mice are close to the phenotypic optimum
or there is a developmental limitation on tail length. Lastly,
plasticity in ear length of Brazil house mice goes in the same direction
as the plastic response of New York house mice (Figure 6B), further
illustrating adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The overall degree and
directionality of plasticity in extremities mirror patterns associated
with Allen's rule.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

We described phenotypic patterns consisten with Bergmann's rule and
Allen's rule in house mice collected across the Americas. We also
dissentangled the contributions of genetics and plasticity to these
ecogeographic patterns. First, we found that wild house mice conform to
Bermgann's rule and Allen's rule, as house mice are larger in size with
shortened extremities in northern latitudes. Second, persistent
differences in body mass and tail length in a common environment across
many generations indicated a genetic basis to Bergmann's rule and
Allen's rule, reflecting thermoregulatory adaptations. Finally, we
measured the contributions of phenotypic plasticity underlying these
ecogeographic patterns and revealed that extremity length is highly
plastic in response to cold temperature, while body size is unaffected.
This plastic response in extremity length to cold temperatures appears
adaptive, matching the direction and magnitude of the evolved response
in temperate house mice. Adaptive plasticity associated with Allen's
rule, in conjunction with strong selection for body size, likely
promoted the rapid expansion of house mice into new environments across
the Americas.

Parallel phenotypic clines across multiple transects provide strong
evidence for natural selection (Endler 1977). Body mass in house mice
increases as latitude increases (Figure 1A-B), resembling patterns seen
in eastern North America (Lynch 1992; Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018), South
America (Suzuki et al. 2020), and Australia (Tomlinson and Withers
2009). These clinal patterns are consistent with Bergmann's rule and
reflect an evolved response to differences in environmental temperature.
Phenotypic measurements of second- and tenth-generation lab-reared mice
from temperate and tropical populations revealed a genetically
determined difference in body mass, with mice from colder climates
significantly larger than mice from tropical environments (Figure 2A).
These results agree with previous studies also finding a genetic basis
for Bergmann's rule in house mice from eastern North America (Lynch
1992; Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018), western North America (Ferris et al.
2021), and South America (Suzuki et al. 2020), and suggest that there
has been strong directional selection for body size in house mice.
Selection over short time scales for Bergmann's rule has also been shown
for other non-native species, such as \emph{Drosophila}, one of the
best-documented examples for a genetic basis of Bergmann's rule.
Specifically, body size clines in \emph{Drosophila} have been repeated
across continents, in common garden experiments, and through
experimental evolution studies (Cavicchi et al. 1985; Coyne and Beecham
1987; Partridge et al. 1994; James et al. 1995; Land et al. 1999; Huey
et al. 2000; Gilchrist et al. 2001, 2004). The formation of Bergmann's
rule has also occurred rapidly across introduced populations of house
sparrows (Johnston and Selander 1964, 1971) and starlings (Cardilini et
al. 2016). Together, these results suggest that introduced species may
experience strong selection as they expand their geographic range into
new environments, allowing clines such as Bergmann's rule to establish
rapidly.

Patterns for Allen's rule were consistent for tail length only, with
mice from the equator having longer tails than mice from northern
latitudes (Figure 1C-D). These patterns are recapitualed in the lab and
across generations, demonstrating a genetic basis for tail length
(Figure 2B). Shorter tails in northern populations of house mice likely
confer selection for heat conservation and adaptation to the cold, as
tail length shows a positive correlation with tempeature of the coldest
month across rodents (Alhajeri et al. 2020). Similar trends and
correlations have also been found for limb length and bill length in
birds (Nudds and Oswald 2007; Symonds and Tattersall 2010; Danner and
Greenberg 2015; Friedman et al. 2017). In addition to thermoregulatory
advantages, alternative mechanisms for Allen's rule have been postulated
to explain why longer tails are found in the tropics, such as enhanced
climbing ability with increased arboreality (Alroy 2019; Mincer and
Russo 2020). Because house mice are commensal with humans, it is
unlikely that longer tails confer a climbing advantage in the tropics,
though this warrants future investigation. Furthermore, we do not see a
genetic basis for ear length in American house mice (Figure 2C).
Although ear length shows a negative correlation with latitude (Figure
1E-F), this is likely driven by plasticity.

Body size in house mice shows very little plasticity in response to cold
temperature (Figures 3 and 5), reaffirming that there has likely been
strong directional selection for body size in house mice. Lack of
plasticity associated with Bergmann's rule is consistent with previous
studies in laboratory mice (Sumner 1909, 1915; Ashoub 1958; Serrat et
al. 2008; Serrat 2013) and, in addition to selection, may be due to a
number of physiological factors. First, the environmental influence of
temperature may need to occur pre-weaning or prenatal to elicit a
plastic response (e.g., Weaver and Ingram 1969). Second, temperatures
pushing endotherms outside their thermoneutral zone have repeatadly been
shown to reduce body mass (Ashoub 1958; Gordon 2012; Burness et al.
2013; Andrew et al. 2017), suggesting that both Brazil mice and New York
mice would also show reductions in body mass. Lastly, traits that
provide flexible and immediate heat conservation, such as increased fur
insulation (e.g., Sumner (1915); Weaver and Ingram (1969)), may be an
intial phenotypic response associated with Bergmann's rule, and not body
size itself.

Unlike Bergmann's rule, Allen's rule can be generated via developmental
phenotypic plasticity, as extremity length is highly senstive to ambient
temperature in both mammals and birds (Serrat 2014; Tattersall et al.
2017). Our results in wild house mice agree with previous studies in
mammals, with mice growing shorter tails and ears in a cold environment
(Figure 6; Ogle and Mills (1933); Harland (1960); Chevillard et al.
(1963); Weaver and Ingram (1969)). In laboratory mice, temperature
direclty affects the growth of cartilage in both tails and ears,
impacting extremity length (Serrat et al. 2008). Furthermore, the
universal patterns of tail length plasticity in response to cold is also
recapitualted at the skeletal level, with both the length and number of
caudal vertebrae decreasing in response to cold temperatures in mice
(Barnett 1965; Noel and Wright 1970; Thorington Jr 1970; Al-Hilli and
Wright 1983). Although we did not measure skeletal differences between
New York and Brazil mice, it is likely that the tail length plasticity
we observed is a result of plasticity in both number and length of
individual caudal vertebrae. Moreover, ear length shows the greatest
plasticity in both populations, with both New York and Brazil mice
growing shorter ears in the cold. The pronounced plastic response of
ears compared to tails may indicate that smaller appendages consisting
entirely of cartilage are less developmentally canalized. Less
constraint associated with extremities may also underly the highly
plastic nature of Allen's rule compared to Bergmann's rule.

\subparagraph{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Adaptive phenotypic plasticity and
Allen's
rule}}{Adaptive phenotypic plasticity and Allen's rule}}\label{adaptive-phenotypic-plasticity-and-allens-rule}}

Phenotypic plasticity is adaptive when it aligns with the direction of
selection, moving traits closer to the local phenotypic optima (Baldwin
1896; West-Eberhard 2003; Ghalambor et al. 2007). We show evidence for
adaptive phenotypic plasticity underlying Allen's rule, as plasticity
produces shorter ears and tails in cold environments. We also observed
an attenuated plastic response for tail length in New York house mice,
suggesting New York mice are closer to the phenotypic optimum and are
better adapted to colder environments. Overall, plasticity in house
mouse extremities mirror general evolutionary patterns of shorter
extremity lengths in colder climates and may play an important role in
generating Allen's rule.

There are two outcomes by which adaptive phenotypic plasticity can
facilitate adaptive evolution. Adaptive plasticity can incompletely move
the trait value closer to the phenotypic optimum, with directional
selection refining the trait value, leading to subsequent genetic
changes (Price et al. 2003; Ghalambor et al. 2007). Or, adaptive
plasticity can slow or impede evolution by moving individuals completely
to the phenotypic optimum, shielding genetic variation from natural
selection (Price et al. 2003; Ghalambor et al. 2007). Intriguingly, we
find evidence for each of these two scenarios in different house mouse
extremities. In tails, we see evidence for the first scenario, with both
genetic and plastic contributions generating shorter tails in colder
environments. Despite the plastic response of tail length in Brazil mice
recapitulating the magnitude of the evolved response of New York mice,
we see clear evidence of genetic differences in tail length between New
York and Brazil house mice. This suggests that phenotypic plasticity
moves tail length close to the local optimum but does not shield it from
subsequent selection. However, in ears, we see no evidence for genetic
differences among tropical and temperate house mouse populations,
indicating that the observed plastic response to cold temperatures may
shield ear length from selection and fully account for observed ear
length differences among populations and across latitude. Overall, both
scenarios of adaptive phenotypic plasticity with Allen's rule, in
addition to strong, directional selection underlying Bergmann's rule,
likely facilitated the rapid expansion of house mice into new
environments across the Americas.

\textbf{Figure 1. Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule in American house
mice.} Associations between body mass (A-B), tail length (C-D), ear
length (E-F), and absolute latitude across wild-caught North and South
American house mice. Tail length and ear length are plotted as the
residuals of a regression of body mass on extremity length. Individuals
are represented as individual points, with males denoted in black and
females denoted in white. Results from Spearman correlations are
presented in each plot, along with sample sizes. For clarity, standard
error shading is ommitted from linear regression lines associated with
the VertNet Metadata panels (A,C,E).

\textbf{Figure 2. Body mass and tail length differences among
populations persist over generations in a common lab environment.}
Differences in body mass (A), tail length (B), and ear length (C)
between New York mice (blue) and Brazil mice (gold) across generations.
Tail length and ear length are plotted as the residuals of a regression
of body mass on extremity length. Population-level data are depticted as
boxplots overlayed on density plots, with boxplot vertical lines
denoting 1.5x the inerquartile range. Individuals are represented as
individual points, and the horizontal variation within each generation
determined randomally to separate points. Results from linear models are
presented in each plot. Sample sizes: (A) n = 441; (B) n = 432; (C) n =
434.

\textbf{Figure 3. Evolved differences in body mass across development.}
Body mass growth trajectories across environments in New York (blue) and
Brazil (gold) house mice. Cold-reared mice are denoted as dotted lines
and warm-reared mice are denoted as solid lines. Individuals are plotted
as semi-transparent points (n = 80), with population means depicted as
smoothed regression fits, with standard error shading. The same
individuals depicted here are also depicted in Figure 5.

\textbf{Figure 6. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in extremity length
among New York and Brazil house mice.} Tail length (A) and ear length
(B) residuals were calculated by regressing from body mass. Individuals
are represented as individual points (tail length residuals: n = 80; ear
length residuals: n = 78), with New York mice denoted in blue and Brazil
mice denoted in gold. Boxplots indicate the 25th, median, and 75th
quartiles. Both sexes were combined as there were no sex-specific
differences in extremity length. Results from linear mixed models are
presented in each plot. The same individuals depicted here are also
depicted in Figure 4.
