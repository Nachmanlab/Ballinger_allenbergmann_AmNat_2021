**Running title:** Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule in house mice

\newpage

## Abstract (200 words)


\newpage

## Introduction

##### **Clines in phentoypes have historically been used as evidence for natural selection - specifically adaptation to different environments/temps.** Strong clines in phenotypes (Huxley) have historically been suggested to represent natural selection/local adaptation to environments (Endler).
Two of the most well described phenotypic/latitudinal clines are Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule. Bergmann's rule states......, while Allen's rule states....(XXX;XXX). Numerous studies have documented/found evidence for either of these rules in their respective taxa or across species, using wild-caught data. There have also been various meta-analyses trying to calculate the overall effect size of correlations of Bermgann's rule or Allen's rule across endothermic groups. All of these studies have shown mixed results of agreement (though weak) or disagreemend with these broad geographic rules. And these conclusions have largely been based off of wild-caught phenotypic data.
-- Meta-analyses/syntheses focus on "yes" or "no" if Bergmann's rule is present, using various metrics (e.g. latitude, mean daily temp, etc); thus, the literautre is clouded and we still do not know what mechanisms underly these rules. --

##### **Missing from these discussions are careful analyses of which traits are genetically and/or environmentally determined, which would help elucidate the factors "controlling"/underlying these rules.**

## Materials and Methods

## Results

##### **1. Stronger evidence for Bergmann's rule (Figure 1A) than Allen's rule (Figure 1B) in wild-caught American house mice.**

##### **2. Clear genetic basis for Bergmann's rule (Figure 2A) but not Allen's rule (Figure 2B) in New York and Brazil house mice.**

##### **3. Developmental plasticity plays a signficant role in "shaping" Allen's rule (Figure 3B) in American house mice.**

##### **4.  Evidence for adaptive plasticity in tail length (Figure 4B).**

**Figure 1. The relationship between body weight, tail length, and absolute latitude in North and South American house mice.**
Significant coorelation between body mass (A) and latitude, but not tail length (B) and latitude in wild-caught house mice. Tail length residuals were calculated by regressing tail length from body mass. Both plots include males and females, with individuals represented as individual point. Results from Spearman correlations are presented in each plot. Sample sizes: (A) n = 215; (B) n = 212.

**Figure 2. Body mass and tail length differences between populations and across generations in a common lab environment.**
Body mass differences among populations persist over two generations in lab (A), indicating a genetic basis. No clear differences in tail length (B) are seen between populations, suggesting the inherent "plastic"/"noisy" nature of tail length. Tail length residuals were calculated by regressing tail length from body mass. Population-level data are depticted as boxplots overlayed on density plots, with boxplot vertical lines denoting 1.5x the inerquartile range. Individuals are represented as individual points. Results from linear mixed models are presented in each plot. Only signifiant interactions are depicted in (A). Sample sizes: (A) n = 438; (B) n = 427. \**P*<0.05, \*\**\*P* <0.01.

**Figure 3. Body mass and tail length growth trajectories across environments.**
Cold temperatures have very little influence on overall body mass in New York and Brazil house mice (A). Tail length is highly influenced by cold temperatures, with cold-housed mice growing shorter tails compared to warm-housed mice (B). Both New York and Brazil house mice show plasticity in tail length across development. Individuals are represented as individual points (n = 80), with population means depicted as smoothed regression fits, with standard error shading.

**Figure 4. Evolved and plastic phenotypic variation among New York and Brazil house mice.**
Very little plasticity in body mass in New York and Brazil house mice (A). Tail length is highly plastic in both populations, with tails growing shorter in the cold (B). Brazil house mice show adaptive plasticity in tail length. Tail length residuals were calculated by regressing tail length from body mass. Vertical lines on boxplots denote 1.5x the interquartile range. Individuals are represented as individual points (n = 80). Results from linear mixed models are presented in each plot, with the following significance levels: \**P*<0.05, \*\**P* <0.01, \*\*\**P* <0.001, \*\*\*\**P* <0.0001
