## Abstract (200 words)

We use house mice to test the hypothesis that allen's rule is more plastic (and influenced by the environment) than Bergmanns rule, and therefore, one needs to explicity test for genetics and plasticity when generalizing about broad, ecogeographic patterns

\newpage

## Introduction

Dissentaningly plasticity from genetics is rarely accomplished when "looking" for evidence for ecogeographic patterns in taxa across wide latitudinal distributions.
Dissentangling plasticity from genetics has proven difficult when assessing braod ecogeographic patterns within and across taxa.

##### **Clines in body size (Bergmann's Rule) and extremity length (Allen's Rule) have historically been used as evidence for natural selection, but accurately dissentangling genetics from plasticity is not possible using data from wild-caught specimens.**
Adaptation to different temps/envs
Def Berg Allen
Evience in species ()
Two of the most well described phenotypic clines are Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule, with various support across both endotherms and ectotherms. Strong clines in phenotypes (Huxley) have historically been suggested to represent natural selection/local adaptation to environments (Endler). Two very well described phenotypic clines are Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule. These rules traditionally have been used to describe phenotypes in endotherms, though there is evidence for these rules in ectotherms. humans from different populations also show different adaptations to their local environment
Meta-analyses/syntheses focus on "yes" or "no" if Bergmann's rule is present, using various metrics (e.g. latitude, mean daily temp, etc); thus, the literautre is clouded and we still do not know what mechanisms underly these rules.

Missing from this discussion ---- is careful analysis of what is genetically and/or env determined

Many of the traits under these umbrellas are complex traits, thus they are both polygenic and environmentally determined. (polygenic AND env)

Challenge of collating metadata from many diff labs - how do we use this data meaningfully? accurately dissentangling genetics from plasticity is not possible using data from wild-caught specimens.**


Although meta-analyses caputre a large number and variety of organisms, they also capture a lot of noise. The positives about individual studies is that researchers are likely to collect data in the same, careful way across gradients. One clear example of this is evdience of Bergmann's rule in house mice in the Americas (Lynch, 1992; Phifer-Rixey et al, 2018; Suzuki et al, 2020), where data collected on wild-caught house mice across latitdue by "careful standards" shows Bergmann's rule; however, collating all house mouse records from VertNet depicts a less-clear cline (Fig. S1).

##### **Only a handful of studies have dissected the genetic and phenotypically plastic nature of Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule, showing plasticity plays a large role underlying these classic phenotypic clines. However, these studies only investigated clines across a narrow geographic range.** (reference table 1?)


Why house mice!!
We exapand upon what Serrat and Barnett etc. found by comparing two locally adapted populations that differ in these biogeographic traits


##### **House mice inhabit a very broad range of latitudes across the Americas, and previous research has shown evidence for Bergmann's rule. Moreover, there has been much research done on the inheritent plastic nature of extremity length (like tails and ears), but these studies only investigated single populations that show no variation in starting phenotypes. Overall, little has been done regarding genetics and/or plasticity of Bergmann'r rule and  Allen's rule.**
Previous evidence for Bergmann's rule in American house mice (e.g. Phifer-Rixey et al, 2018; Suzuki et al, 2020) was likely found because (1) the overall small sample sizes that were collected, and (2) the same research group collected the data in roughly the same manner.
House mice are great since they have very broad geographic/latitudinal distribution across the Americas.

##### **In order to dissect the genetic and plastic underpinnings of these ecogeographic rules, first have variation in starting populations where populations are different (and presumably locally adapted to their environments), and perform common garden experiments to dissentangle genetics from plasticity. Here, we use house mice collected from ends of a latitiudinal cline and ask about the genetic and plastic underpinnings to these broad eco-geographic rules.**


Here we use a combination of approaches to tease apart
We address the follwing

## Materials and Methods

##### **1. Metadata corresponding to Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule in wild-caught American house mice.**
Wild-caught house mouse specimens collected throughout its invasive range of North and South America were download from Arctos, under the "Environmental adaptation" Nachman lab project. Details and speciem collection for this project have been detailed elsewhere (e.g. Phifer-Rixey, 2018; Suzuki 2019; Suzuki 2020). Briefly, house mice were collected across its broad, latitudinal range in North and South America between 2012-2014. Mice were caught in the warmest months in each of the associated ranges/populations, and specimens were prepared in a standard way (with only a few collectors) and deposisted in the MVZ. Because mice were collected by only a few people, over a set of months, and measurements were collected in a standard way, this metadata is inherently less noisy than most museum-based collection metada. For downstrem analyses, specimens collected over 1500m in elevation were ommitted, as well as pregnant females and juvenile/subadult specimens. Only wild-caught, non-colony founder mice were used for downstream analyses, totallying in (XXXX) specimens.

To get a broader feel for Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule in American house mice, we also downloaded all house mouse data entries from VertNet. (Insert filtering criteria here.) With this final, clean, and filtered dataset, we tested for evidence of Bergmann's rule and Allen's by assessing the relationship of body weight and tail length across absolute latitude.


##### **2. Metadata of wild-caught colony founders and subsequent generations to assess genetic basis of traits.**
Wild-derived colonies of house mice were established from wild mice collected from the ends of their latitudinal cline (see Phifer-Rixey 2018 and Suzuki 2020 for details). Briefly, house mice from upstate New York and equatorial Brazil were brought back to the lab where full sib mating was initiated. Phenotypic data from colony founders and each subsequent generation were collected. Data for the first few generations of each colony was downloaded from the Arctos lab project. Non-pregnant females were kept for downstream analyses, alongside males.


##### **3. Common garden experiment to assess relative role of phenotypic plasticity to traits.**
To assess the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule, we performed a common garden experiment using a full-sib design. Mice from two lines were used from each colony to represent populations, and each line was past the 10th generation (i.e. N=11/12) of full-sib inbreeding (i.e. New York = SARA and SARB; Brazil = MANA and MANB). Mice were born at room temperature and singly housed at weaning (3 weeks of age) at room temperature. At 3.5 weeks of age, mice were moved to their respective experiemntal temperature, either staying at room temperature or placed in a cold chamber (~5oC). Mice were housed in their respective experimental environments until ~11 weeks of age. Body weight and tail length were measured once a week for each mouse. At the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed and standard museum measurements were taken. Skeletons were also kept, processed, and deposited in the MVZ.


##### **4. Skeletal differences between populations and environments.**
Uncleaned skeletons were CT scanned at UC Berkeley to assess skeletal differences in tail length (since it is extremeley hard (and dangerous) to count caudaul vertebrae on cleaned skeletons). The number and length of longest caudal vertebrae were measured using Oxirix software. After scanning, all skeletons were cleaned and processed in the MVZ prep lab. The following skeletal measurements were measured on clean skeletons, using digital calipers: skull length (), skull width (), nasal length (), right humerus length, right radius length, right femur length, and right tibia length. All skeletons were deposisited into the MVZ.

## Results

##### **1. Stonger evidence for Bergmann's rule (body weight)[Figure 1A] than Allen's rule (tail length)[Figure 1B] in wild-caught American house mice.**
[Weak patterns of Bergmann's rule (Figure S1A) and Allen's rule (Figure S1B) in North American and South American house mice, using all VertNet house mouse data.][]
To illustrate the difficulties of working with museum specimens to "paint broad pictures" of patterns, we assess evidence for Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule in a large Mus dataset (from Vertnet). These data illustrate the inherent noisy nature of Bergmann's rule using museum-collected data (e.g. unknown specimen ages, variation in collectors and measurements taken, temporal varation of metadata, etc.). It is difficult to confidently say anything about the "presence" (or "absence") of Bergmann's rule/Allen's rule using museum metadata, let alone the underlying mechanisms "controlling/forming/driving/of" these clines (e.g. temperature, precipitation, etc.).
These results speak to the power of having one or a few collectors take the same measurements in a controlled way. Although this still doesn't dissentangle genetics from plasticity, it gives more support and confidence in these metadata that are being collected. Without this "carefulness", it proves difficult to say anything meaningful.
-- In order to confidentally reveal morphological differences and dissentangle genetics and plasticity, a common garden experiment needs to be performed, using mice from the ends of the American latitudinal transect. --


##### **2. Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule have a genetic basis in American house mice.**
[Population differences in body weight(Bergmann's Rule) (Figure 2A) and tail length(Allen's Rule) (Figure 2B) persist in a common environment across multiple generations, indicating a genetic basis.][]
House mice collected from ends of latitudinal range are significanlty different in body size, and these differences persist across generations, indicating a genetic basis. Differences in body size exist in wild mice, and across generations. In contrast, tail length differences are not seen in wild mice but are "revealed" (though not signficant pop differences) across generations, when mice are developing in a common environment. Differences in tail length in inbred mice persist across generation (though again, not signficant), indicating a genetic basis. These data highlight the importance of developmental environment and the role developmental plasticity plays on certain traits, like extremity length. It is not surprising tail length is not different in wild mice, since presumably, both populations were born during warm temperatures. Morevoer, across generations, there is a slight decrease in tail length in both populations (with Brazil continuously having longer tails than New York, though New Yorks tails decrease the most dramatically between wild and first two generations), perhaps suggesting an inherent plastic nature to this trait. However, these data are also noisy (though not as noisy as VertNet), so it is difficult to confidently ascertain the role of phenotypic plasticity in this observation. The inherent noise is probably the reason why not significant population-level differences are seen, since multiple individuals measured tail length, which is more variable than body weight. Also, mice are all different ages (ranging from XXXX to XXXX). Do these data suggest that genetic basis of body size is "stronger" than genetic basis for tail length? OR that just tail length is just way more variable and highly influenced by environment.
BOTH developmental plasticity and human error contributing to variance in tail length. But developmental plasticity is starting to be revealed in these data; but human error still make it messy and hard to see.
-- In order to precisley measure the impacts of plasticity on these ecogeographic traits, we must do a *controlled*, common garden experiemnt. --

##### **3. Body size differences persist throughout development, with very little influence of plasticity.**
##### **3.The genetic and plastic bases of Bergmann's rule American house mice.**
[Body size differences are evident at weaning and persist throughout development. Cold temperature has very little influence on body size.][]
volved differences in body size are evident at weaning and persist throughout development, with New York mice being larger than Brazil mice across both sexes (Figure 3A; Figure Sxxx). Cold temperature has very little influence on the development of body size. Differences in body size are mostly genetic, as body size shows little plasticity across both populations and sexes (Figure 4A). This inherent lack-of-plasticity in body size is not merely a result of increased adiposity or differences in adiposity but instead is also seen at the skeletal level (Fig Sx (correlation plots of skeletal trait vs body length)).


##### **4. Developmental plasticity plays a signficant role in "forming" Allen's rule in American house mice.**
[Unlike body weight, differences in tail length occur later in development (Figure 4A) and are highly influenced by temperature, with tails growing shorter in cold environments.][]
[Extremity length (tail length) is more plastic in response to cold temperatures than is body size in American house mice.][]
Tail length is highly plastic in response to cold temperature, with mice in cold envrionments growing shorter tails, regardless of population. The degree of this plasticity is more pronouned in Brazil mice, with cold-reared Brazil mice growing much shorter tails than warm-reared Brazil mice. In fact, the tail lenght of cold-reared Brazil mice "reaches" the length of the evolved tail length of New York mice (Figure 3B). This variation in developmental plasticity gives rise to populaiton-level differences in tail length, with Brazil having longer tails than New York. Moreover, unlike body size, tail length is highly plastic in response to cold temperature, with mice in cold envrionments growing shorter tails, regardless of population. The degree of this plasticity is more pronouned in Brazil mice, with cold-reared Brazil mice growing much shorter tails than warm-reared Brazil mice. In fact, the tail lenght of cold-reared Brazil mice "reaches" the length of the evolved tail length of New York mice. Tail length shows both a genetic basis and a plastic basis (Figure 4B) in response to cold temperatures. Specifically, Brazil mice have longer tails than New York mice, but when placed in a cold environment, the tail length of Brazil mice is roughly the same tail length of New York mice (Figure 4B). This plastic response seems to be an exmaple of adaptive phentoypic plasticity. New York mice show very little plasticity in both body size and tail length, presumably because these traits are adatpive in a cold, temperate environment and/or tail length in New York mice is canalized for the given temperature.
-- To explore the different genetic and plastic bases of tail length in New York mice and Brazil mice, the number and length of *longest* caudal vertebrae were measured. --


##### **5. Evolved and plastic differences in the number and length of caudal vertebrae underlie genetic and plastic bases of tail length (Allen's rule) in American house mice.**
[Brazil mice have more caudal vertebrae compared to New York mice (Figure 5A), and there is population-level differences in plasticity of these traits (Figure 5B).][]
----- Need to anlayze this data before elaborating on any further -----
Might have panel A be tail length rxn norm (instead of having it in fig. 4), and then panels B&C be about cadual vertebrae

## Discussion

Given how noisy wild-data are, "seeing" a cline in a phenotypic trait suggests pretty good evidence that selection has acted on tehat trait (Endler).



Many studies set out to assess whether there is evidence for Bergmann's rule and/or Allen's rule in their taxa or groups of taxa based on data collected on wild-caught specimens. Dismissing evidence for either based on wild-caught specimen data is ill-advised and premature, as specimen data (stored in museums) is very messy and confounded by a whole suite of uncontrolled variables (Figs 1, S1). Just because one "sees" or doesn't "see" these rules in wild data does not mean these patterns do or do not exist. It is imperative to assess the relative contributions of both genetics and plasticity in a careful way, either through common garden experiments or recipricoal transplant experiments. Obviously this is not feasible for all taxa but our data highlight how having one or a few individuals collect these metadata in a carefully designed way can (or cannot) reveal patterns of these rules (Figure 1). But assessing these patterns using large museum datasets can be misleading (compare Figure 1 to Figure S1).
Perhaps it is "easier" to "see" Bergmann's rule given consistent measurements and how body weight is less prone to measuring error. Unlike body weight, extremity length can vary quite a lot between collectors, which is perhaps why extremity lenght data are inherently more noisy than body weight data. However, it is likely that tail length does not follow Allen's rule in wild-caught speciemns because of it is strong inherent developmental plasticity. And because most mice in temperate regions are born during warmer months, it is not surprising that tail length does not differ too much. However, it is clear that selection has played a role in shaping tail length, as population level differences in tail length and caudal vertebrae do exist, and these differences have a genetic basis. So, developmental plasticity is NOT the whole picture when it comes to extremity length.




Genetics of tail length differences (specifically vertebrae differences) brought upon by selection for climbing ability? (More smaller vertebrae is more flexible for climbing than just larger, fewer vertebrae)
Future research direction or question would be to assess if biomechanical constraint also limits how much inherent plasticity can act on those traits

## Introduction

* All things clines (Endler, 1977)
      - Clines in phenotypic traits have assumed to be genetically determined and locally adapted (Endler 1977)
      - However, very few studies have dissentatngled genetics and plasticiity from clines (Stillwell, 2010)
Default explanatation of the mechanism maintaing geographic cline in morphology: "assumed to be natural selection for polygenic traits that represent adaptation to local conditions" (quoted from James 1983; citation from Endler 1977)

differences in primary productivity probs not playing as strong of role in house mice since they are commensal with humans

* Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule are two of the best described eco-greogrpahic rules ("clines") in endotherms (definitions for both).
  - Allen:
  - Bergmann:

These "classic" clines were originally (and continue to be?) viewed as a result of natural selection. However, there is strong evidence for the highly inate plastic nature of Allen's rule. Specifically, Allen's rule might be a result of developmental plasticity, even with or without a thermoregulation advantage.

(Are ecothermic examples of Bergmann's rule (Drosophila - rapid evolution of body size differences))

* Numerous meta-analyses studies have found support (or lack of support) for Bergmann's Rule and Allen's Rule across latitude (and across various abiotic measurments)

* The contributions of both plastiicty and genetics to phenotypic clines??
  - however, very few have dissected the genetic and plastic causes for these biogeographic rules. (Very few have invenstigated the extent to which clinal variation is environmentally induced (but see James, 1983 (Science)))
    - of the studies that have, they only used one population (exposed to diff treatments) and not (at least) two populations (that are locally adapted and show Allen/Bergmann) and show responses to diff treatments
    - we know that many of these traits (Allen's Rule) are highly influenced by developmental temperature; thus we investigated developmental plasticity
Allen's rule has been shown to have a plastic component (Serrat et al 2008); however, this study was done in lab mice, where no variation in tail length was present.

common garden studies rearing individuals with distinct phenotypes in different environmental conditions

* Here, we use house mice to ask about the contributions of genetics and plasticity to ecogeographic rules.
  - House mice are an ideal system to ask this question as they have very broad latitudinal distributions, ranging from the tip of SA up to Alaska. There is clear evidence for Bergmann's Rule in American house mice, with mice along the east coast (Lynch, 1992; Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018) showing Bergmann's Rule and mice across a broader range of North America and South America (Suzuki et al. 2020). These trends for Bergmann's Rule is much stronger when only looking at a few hundred samples (Lynch, Phifer-Rixey, Suzuki). However, the nature of wild data is messy.
  - Previous research has shown Bergmann's Rule along east coast of NA (Lynch, 1992; Phifer-Rixey et al., 2018) and throughout NA and SA (Suzuki et al. 2020). These studies show that body size differences have a genetic basis. **However, this is just a snapshot of the total range of house mice (especially in regards to sample size). And what about Allen's Rule??**
  - Barnett and Serrat have also shown plasticity in various ecogeographic traits. **However, both studies started from one population. Doesn't tell you about relative roles plasticity plays in populations that are locally adapted and (at the start) differ in traits**

(Is my study the first to dissect genetics and plasticity *across* populations that are (locally) adapted to their environments? (where Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule are present))

My study dissects the genetics and plasticity *across* populations that are (locally) adapted to their environments, where Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule are present.

	- Temperature (along with other environmental features) scales with latitude
* What are the most common ways people "look" for these rules? Is it mostly characterized in wild animals? What are the general traits measured for evidence of both rules?
* When there is evidence, is the mechanism genetic? When there is less evidence, is the mechanism plasticity?

* Characterizing these rules in wild animals does not dissentangle what is genetically controlled and what is plastic.

* What are the mechanisms underlying these two rules?
* What are the relative contributions of genetics and/or plasticity underlying these broad, eco-geographic rules?
* Are certain morphological features determined more by genetics or plasticity than other morpholgical features? (Especially if temperature plays a large role in these rules...)

* We address these questions using the house mouse as a model system.
	- House mice have broad, geographic range
	- There is regional evidence for Bergmann's rule (Lynch 1992)
	- There is evidence for effects of temperature on morphology (morphological traits that are used for these eco-geographic patterns) - Barnett studies in wild, Australian house mice

Many studies also measure skeletons of museum specimens to ask about Bergmann's Rule
	- These skeletal measurements are done on wild-caught specimens, in which phenotypic plasticity could've 'shaped' them. But sampling across populations (and even species) gives stronger support for these rules. But still don't quite understand the mechanisms.

, as body weight could be due to increased adiposity in more northern, seasonal, cold populations.
	- We also measured skeletal features and Bergmann's Rule is still prominenet across various skeletal features

Or when the mechanism is attempted to be eluded to, only one population is investigated, which doesn't capture the full effect of these eco-geographic rules that characterize phenotpyic varation across latitude.
	- Serrat only looked at one population (or actually, a common lab mouse strain) and did find that temperature impacts Allen's Rule.
	- Because Serrat only used one population, body size and tail length were the same at the start; my experiment has different starting points (i.e. different populations that are locally adapted to their environment)
	- However, it is unknown if plasticity and/or genetics plays a larger role in one population versus another.

## Results
#####(format with subheadings corresponding to each of the major results and then a few sentences or a paragraph for each referencing the appropriate figures and/or tables)

### (1) The relationship between absolute latitude, body mass, and extremity length in wild house mice collected across the Americas.
    - Evidence for both Bergmann's rule (strong/sign) and Allen's rule (less strong/non-sign) across broad, introduced range of house mice across Americas (wild animals) *is inherently messy with uncontrolled sources of variation*
**These data show evidence for both rules, but we still don't know relative contributions of plasticity and genetics to both. Must do common garden experiment**

#### Population-level differences in body mass persist in a common environment. Population-level differences in extremity length are revealed in the lab and persist in a common environment ("Contributions of genetics to Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule")
* Four-panel figure of sex-specific differences in body mass and tail length (or ear length?) across generations in the lab
**Degree of change (though diet-induced but could be temperature-induced) between wild and N2 generation "depict/correspond" to "amount" of inherent plasticity associated with a trait? (e.g. Baier and Hoekstra fig)**
	  - Populations from the 'ends' of the latitudinal range were brought back to the lab and bred for multiple generations
	  - There is a genetic basis for both Bergmann's Rule (body weight)(strong) and Allen's rule (tail and ear length)(less strong), as these traits persist across generations
	          - This genetic basis of Allen's Rule is "revealed" in the lab, as wild specimens don't show Allen's Rule (which gives "stronger" argument that we're makign)
		- Allen's rule may be less strong as differences don't 'come about' until 'adult stage', while body size differences occur at conception/weaning (next results). Thus, temperature still has the opportunity to play a larger role in something like tail length, whereas genetics plays a much larger role in body size. Is there stronger selection in temperate environments to be larger earlier, while less selection or more buffer (plasticity) regarding extremities? (recent deer mouse paper shows HA pups grow faster?)
**Next, what about plasticity? We use temperature since it strongly covaries with latitude and is different between populations**

* Contributions of phenotypic plastiicty (in response to temperature) to Allen's and Bergmann's rules - common garden experiment
	- We are interested in population level differences; thus, we 'grouped' lines by population. But phenotypes of individual lines are shown in supplemental figures -- **valid??**



**Tail length is highly plastic. Motivated by Serrat studies, we aimed to determine what aspects of tail length are plastic and genetic (differenet number of caudual vertebrae and/or length of vertebrae).**


\newpage

## Discussion


House mice could also be larger at higher latitudes because of it being a more seasonal environment, thus being larger will help with unpredictability of seasonal environemtns (and topor??)

Sand et al. (2005) showed that moose in colder areas had higher growth rates and matured 2 years later than moose in warmer areas. Selection may be acting on life-history characteristics that may be correlated with body size.

exposure to hot temperature may induce more plasticity in body size than what was seen for cold. And likely also elongation of limbs



Both plasticity and selection generate patterns associated with Bergmann's Rule and Allen's Rule.
It is important to dissentangle the two instead of just resorting to selection or no selection if evidence of broad agreement to these rules in wild animals.
Evidence for both is indicated by body size differences and genetic & plastic differences in extremity length.


Tail length may also be playing a role in climbing in Brazil mice. Future directions should determine the consequences of plasticity (or lack of plasticity) in traits that have a biophysical/locomotion pressure associated with them.

## Materials and Methods

#### (1) The relationship between latitude, body mass, and extremity length in wild house mice collected across the Americas

   	- VertNet data of all Mus musculus in introduced range
  	- Analyzed basic museum morphological traits/metadata in association with absolute latitude

"To minimize inclusion of records of non-adult specimens, we identified the smallest mass associated with an identified adult life stage category for each species and removed all records with mass values below this minimum adult size" (Riemer et al. 2018 - eLife)


animals were weight matched at the start to help minimize other potential sources of growth variation to maximize detection of a temperature effect. We also controlled for litter size effects




Why temperature? Because Climate PC1 in Suzuki et al (2020) contains temperature-related variables (e.g., mean temperature of coldest quarter, minimum temperature of coldest month and annual mean temperature), which explains almost 50% of the variation between SA and NA house mouse transects. And winter min temp (Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018) is different across latitude.

- we know that these phenotypic clines/differences are not driven purley by developmental plasticity but also genetics (don't have data past the experimental mice generation (so like N11-14?))

N0 generation mice will have tail lengths that were already determined by their natural environemnt. Body mass, in contrast, can still be determined by lab-envirionemtn since buffet of rodent chow.

## Supplemental Methods and Materials

1. To assess broad patterns/evidence of Bergmann's Rule and Allen's Rule in house mice across the Americas, I downloaded Arctos specimens under the Nachman lab project, ["Environmental adaptation in introduced populations of house mice, Mus musculus, across the Americas"](http://arctos.database.museum/project/10001341). Details of these specimens can be found in (Phifer-Rixey 2018; Suzuki 2019; Suzuki 2020). Briefly, wild house mice were collected across broad latitudinal distributions over North and South America, between the years of 2012-2013/14.
