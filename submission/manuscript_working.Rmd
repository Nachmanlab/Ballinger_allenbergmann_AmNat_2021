Bergmann's rule
*Drosophila*

D. melanogaster in NA = Bergmann's rule in wild and recapitulated in lab [@Coyne1987]
D. melanogaster in Australia = Bergmann's rule in wild and recapitulated in lab [@James1995]
D. melanogaster in SA = Bergmann's rule in wild and recapitulated in lab [@Land1999]

D. subobscura in NA = Bergmann's rule [@Huey2000; @Gilchrist2001]
D. subobscura in SA (compared to NA and EU) = Bergmann's rule in wild and recaptitulaed in lab [@Gilchrist2004a]


Adaptive phenotypic plasticity in body size [@Partridge1994] - EE study for 5 years at two temps = bigger size at lower temp (body size in Drosophila evolves directly in response to temp (in lab E&E exps) in directions consisten with latitudinal clines that are observed in nature)
Compared lat Bermgann's rule in James1995 flies (in wild and lab) &&& phenotypic plasticity of body size (but not plastiicty didn't vary among lat lines) [@Azevedo1998]
Plasticity in body size in EU and SA D. subobscura [@Gilchrist2004b]



Why temperature? Because Climate PC1 in Suzuki et al (2020) contains temperature-related variables (e.g., mean temperature of coldest quarter, minimum temperature of coldest month and annual mean temperature), which explains almost 50% of the variation between SA and NA house mouse transects. And winter min temp (Phifer-Rixey et al. 2018) is different across latitude.
